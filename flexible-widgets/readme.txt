This plugin makes it possible to display a widget on selected categories and/or pages only.

== Description ==

The Flexible Widgets plugin lets you display a widget on any category or page you wish. When setting up the widget, you are able to select the categories and/or pages where you want to display the widget. If none are selected, the widget will be displayed globally on your site, exactly like a default WordPress widget.

Use this plugin if you need your sidebar content to change from page to page in relation to your main content. Especially useful if you want to use WordPress as a CMS.

Flexible Widgets are replacing the default WordPress widgets.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `flexible-widgets` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
